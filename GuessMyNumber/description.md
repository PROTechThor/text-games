Guess My Number the classic number-guessing game, where the player tires to guess a number in as few attempts as possible. The computer will randomly choose a number between 1 and 100, and the player will make a guess on what the number is. Each time the player enters a number guess, the program tells the player whether the guess is too low, too high or correct. When a correct guess is made, the game ends.
