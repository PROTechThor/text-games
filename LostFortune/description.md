Lost Fortune is a personalized text-based adventure game where the player is prompted to enter pieces of information, which will be used by the game to enhance an adventure story.

The game starts with welcoming the player, then giving the player a thousand gold coins. 
Depending on the story we want to tell, we shall get a bunch of info from the player, which will be used to personalize the story. 
Our story will talk of pirates on a ship (returning from a treasure hunt) at sea, caught by a storm. 
The storm rocks the boat, throwing a certian number of pirates overboard and killing them. 
When the pirates finally find land, they share the gold coins equally with the number of survivors, giving any remainder to the captain.
